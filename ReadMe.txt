1. About:

AbstractCats.org (pre-pandemic) is my personal website. I'm currently in the process of completely revamping the site. Stay tuned for updates!

2. Goals:

While this serves as a personal site, it's also designed to be my primary portfolio project.

My primary goal for this project is to land my first job in the tech industry.

As an additional project, I'm considering creating a music type database using SQL and potentially Python.

3. Tech Stack:

Currently implemented languages include HTML and CSS. JavaScript will be added in the future.
